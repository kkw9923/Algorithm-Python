Exam Creation

This assignment will test your understanding of applying network flow to solve a constrained
selection problem. We want to decide if we have enough questions (in a database)
of a particular type and difficulty level to create a good exam to assess an algorithms
course.

Your teacherâ€™s main goals, as designer, is to provide a range of difficulty (such as
Easy, Medium, Hard) and a diversity of topics (such as Brute Force, Divide and Conquer,
Dynamic Programming). For example, the exam should have a couple very easy questions
and should have at least one really hard question. At disposal is a database of questions
of various topics and difficulty levels. We have a requirement to (hopefully) pick a subset
of these questions to use as the composition of a final exam. Your task for this assignment
is to write a program that checks if we can fulfill the requirements for a good exam to
assess the class. If not, your teacher will be forced to develop a few new questions for the
database.
